FizzBuzz assignment

this was a not too difficult problem to solve. the most difficult part was deciding HOW to resolve it. I settled on just calling a .each method instead of creating a class like we did in the morning because I like when a problem is resolved with very little code being needed. I decided to store all of my potential output in a string variable in order to avoid extra code for concatinating 'Fizz' and 'Buzz'. then to maintain my string variable accross all outputs I converted the input number to a string if the string variable was empty( which would mean it was neither a multiple of 3 or 5).


this is now expanded to adding 'sivv' in place of numbers that are multiples of 7.
